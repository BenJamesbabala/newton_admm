## What is Newton ADMM? 

Newton ADMM is a general ADMM algorithm described in our paper [here]() which 
uses a semi-smooth Newton's method to minimize the ADMM residuals. 

## What is in this repository? 

This repository contains an implementation of Newton ADMM for the 
[SCS](https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs) ADMM iterations. In essence, this is a 
second order ADMM solver for generic cone programming. The signature for the
solver is almost identical to that of SCS, and so the two can be used 
interchangably.  

## Todo

+ Add examples of solvers for specific ADMM problems.
